- 👋 Hi, I’m @Mike-506, I love making apps and webs that make us life easier.
- 👀 I’m interested in full stack developing.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning SQL and ExpressJS, and practicing the front-end part as JavaScript, CSS, HTML using ReactJS. And also I would like to learn TypeScript in the near future.
- 💞️ I'm looking to collaborate on any small or large project to gain more experience, learning from others and also share my knowledge.
